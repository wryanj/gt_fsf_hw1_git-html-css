## Description
This assignment presented us with an html file, a css file, and some related images that were used as assets in the webpage. The task for us was to re factor the code to make sure it was clean, organized semantically, and updated so that it was more efficiently coded to generate the same result. The code we were given worked (generally) with exception to the links, however, it was very messy in both the HTML and CSS file. WIthin the CSS file, there was no clear structure of the file and there were multiple classes and such that could be cut out based on better grouping of CSS properties within a class or by elemenet selector. 

I learned a lot about various CSS properties I had not been exposed to, and I also learned that white space and semantically organized code that follows a similiar top-bottom stucture in the html file and css is much easier to work on and debug, compared to having it jammed together with bad indentation and not a logical outline established. The use of comments to put human readable labels on code blocks also helps to navigate through the code to make fixes, consolidations or improvements. I found I prefer to have lots of white space with indentation to make it easier to see child and parent elements. I also found naming classes the align with their semantic structure is useful. Lastly, I made good use of the build in code inspection feature which helps me to see the code on the screen, and trace back styling issues based on what the inspection window is saying are the cascading styles applied to an element of interest. 

## Installation
I deployed this URL via git hub pages. I modified the code and readme in VS code and did testing with a live server using chrome. 

## Usage
This site is not really usable. As a student, I will however use it as reference to see how I organized my HTML and CSS upon re-factor so that I can use this as a guideline in the future when authoring new code and wanting to keep it clean, structured, and easy to work on. 

## Credits
Due to my time constraints, I worked on this generally alone. I utilized instruction materials from the class instructor as well as W3 resoruces, and some help from my GT tutoring resources. 

## Liscence
Determining best liscence- starting code resource pulled from class and trilogy educatoin.
